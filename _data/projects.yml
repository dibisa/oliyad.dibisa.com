  title: "Predicting the viscosity of latex based on the solid content, density and surface charges"
  description: "Natural rubber latex viscosity varies unpredictably due to solid content, density, and surface charge interactions. I developed a CFD-based predictive model using COMSOL Multiphysics and Python to simulate colloidal flow behavior."
  impact: "Reduced formulation trial-and-error time and enabled accurate viscosity predictions for manufacturing scale-up."
