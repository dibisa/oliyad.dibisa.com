  title: "Characterizing latex viscosity: solid content, density, and surface charge effects"
  description: "Natural rubber latex viscosity varies with solid content, density, and surface charge interactions. Using rheometry measurements, I characterized these relationships and developed a predictive model to interpret the experimental data for formulation optimization."
  impact: "Reduced formulation trial-and-error time and enabled accurate viscosity predictions for manufacturing scale-up."
