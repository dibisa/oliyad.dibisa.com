Hi — I’m Oliyad Dibisa, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering.

My work focuses on sustainable latex-based materials, rheology, and NMR structure–property analysis, with applications in UV-curable systems and additive manufacturing.

Outside the lab: soccer, photography, and ideas about where materials R&D are heading next.
